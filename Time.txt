clock function



delay function is as follows:
void delay(int number_of_seconds)
{
	// Converting time into milli_seconds
	int milli_seconds = 1000 * number_of_seconds;

	// Storing start time
	clock_t start_time = clock();

	// looping till required time is not achieved
	while (clock() < start_time + milli_seconds)
		
}

Explaination of the code:
This code defines a function named "delay" which takes an integer argument "number_of_seconds" representing the number of seconds to delay the program.
The function first calculates the equivalent number of milliseconds by multiplying the argument by 1000.

Next, it stores the current time using the "clock" function in a variable named "start_time".
The function then enters into a loop that continues until the current time returned by the "clock" function exceeds the start time plus the calculated number of milliseconds.

The loop essentially waits for the required time to elapse before returning from the function, effectively delaying the program's execution by the specified number of seconds.
Note that the implementation of the "clock" function may differ between operating systems and environments.
